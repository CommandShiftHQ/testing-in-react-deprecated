# Testing in React lecture

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is built on a demo repo used for the react intro 2 lecture, a simple blog style posts page built using useState, prop types and basic event handlers.

Here we will using Jest, React testing library and React test renderer to add tests that:
- create snapshots
- use valid props for test objects
- fetch elements using queries
- validate elements onn screen using matchers
- mock functions with Jest
- validate functions are being called when triggering an event listener

## Setup
*This repo is intended as a guide for a tutor when giving the lecture*

The `main` branch contains the basic application, this can be forked and used as the base for a fresh repo created over the course of a lecture for the students to use when following along with the video recording.
